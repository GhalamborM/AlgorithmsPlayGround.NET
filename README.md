# Algorithms.NET
## Open source library containing the most used sorting and searching algorithms.

In this library you can find the most used sorting & searching algorithms and that are must know for developers, and their implementation, these algorithms are as follows:

### Sorting:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Counting Sort

### Searching:
- Binary Search
- Ternary Search
- Jump Search
- Linear Search
- Exponential Search


### You can play with these algorithms in ```Algorithms.NET.Debug```

### To view and compare performance of each algorithm, manipulate the code inside :
```SearchingBenchmark.cs``` & ```SortingBenchmark.cs``` 
### To run the benchmarks, comment out :
```var searchingBenchmarkSummary = BenchmarkRunner.Run<SearchingBenchmark>();```
</br>
or 
</br>
 ```var sortingBenchmarkSummary = BenchmarkRunner.Run<SortingBenchmark>();```
 
 Then run the project in ```Release Mode```
 
 ### Here is the explanation of each algorithm:
